# ReactJS To-Do List

![](/public/To-Do.png)

This project was for the Full Stack Developer bootcamp I did and was for a lesson on ReactJS events.

## The Assignment

> Create a simple to-do app using React. A user should be able to enter a
number of items that get displayed as a to-do list in your app. The user
should also be able to delete a specific item from the list.
